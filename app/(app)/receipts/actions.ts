 * rather than filling the select with models the trigger would refuse — the
 * action rejects the run outright in that case, because nothing can run without
 * the provider.
 *
 * Server actions are HTTP endpoints, so this one is as reachable as any other
 * without a session. It answers with the ids the model server has loaded and the
 * models this app is configured to use, which is not an anonymous answer, so an
 * unauthenticated caller gets an empty list rather than either.

 * accepted by Inngest when no function matches it, or the process holding the
 * run can die before its failure handler fires. Either way the row sits in
 * `pending` or `processing` with nothing behind it, and no other path in the app
 * moves it — so the claim has to expire, or the receipt is a dead end.
 *
 * Generous on purpose. A local extraction runs for six to ten minutes, and
 * taking a claim that is genuinely still running produces two runs against one
 * receipt; waiting longer costs the owner a cooldown, taking it too early costs
 * them their data.

 * two runs. It accepts a finished receipt as well as one whose claim has
 * expired, which is the way back in for a receipt whose run never arrived.
 *
 * If the run cannot be enqueued the claim is handed back, because a receipt
 * left claimed with nothing running is indistinguishable from one that is

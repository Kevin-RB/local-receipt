# possum

A local-first web app that turns photos of paper receipts into structured, persisted data.

You upload a receipt photo; a durable background workflow reads the text off it, parses that into a fixed contract, and stores the result next to the image. The same data powers a chat assistant that answers questions about your own spending, a receipts table, and spending charts.

Everything runs on your own hardware: the models are local, the database is Postgres, and the images live in an S3-compatible bucket on your machine.

- **Next.js app** — UI, HTTP API, server actions, the Inngest function definitions, and every call to Postgres, RustFS, and LM Studio. In development it runs on the host; in production it is a standalone non-root Node server. It is the only component in the repo.
- **Browser** — never sees a storage credential. It asks the app for a presigned URL and PUTs the image itself, then subscribes to a realtime channel for progress.
- **RustFS** — S3-compatible object storage for receipt images. Notifies the app over HTTP when an object lands.
- **Inngest** — the durable execution layer. Holds event history, drives retries, and fans out to the function definitions hosted in the app. In development it runs as a container; in production it is Inngest Cloud.
- **LM Studio** — local OpenAI-compatible model server. Two jobs: OCR (vision) and text work (parsing, categorization, chat).
- **Postgres** — the single source of truth. Holds receipts, line items, the category taxonomy, and auth tables.

### How services talk to each other

| From | To | Mechanism | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Browser | App | HTTPS: page loads, `POST /api/upload`, `POST /api/chat`, server actions | Session cookie; `proxy.ts` does an optimistic cookie check, real checks happen in layouts and per route |
| Browser | RustFS | HTTPS `PUT` to a presigned URL | Direct, credential-free, one object key, 5-minute expiry |
| Browser | Inngest | SSE subscription over a realtime channel | Token minted by a server action, scoped to one receipt |
| App | Postgres | `pg` over TCP | Drizzle; every query is owner-scoped |
| App | RustFS | S3 API (`GetObject`, `PutObject`, `DeleteObject`, presign) | App authenticates as a least-privilege IAM user, not root |
| App | LM Studio | OpenAI-compatible HTTP (`/v1/chat/completions`) | AI SDK with `structuredOutputs`; model ids come from `GET /v1/models` |
| App | Inngest | `inngest.send(...)` | Events are the only coupling between producers and workers |
| Inngest | App | HTTP to `/api/inngest` | In dev the dev server polls the app's function definitions; in prod, Cloud invokes them |
| RustFS | App | `POST /api/storage-events` | Bucket notification, authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer $STORAGE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| RustFS-init | RustFS | Admin API, one-shot | Creates the bucket, the notification rule, the IAM user, and its policy |

Two boundaries are worth calling out, because they are the reason the pipeline is shaped the way it is:

**Object storage is the authority on "the upload finished."** The app never confirms its own presigned URL; a receipt sitting in `uploading` means "the browser may or may not have PUT yet." RustFS says so by calling the webhook, and that call is what starts extraction.

**Workers live in the app, but the app is not the only thing that talks to them.** The functions are registered at `/api/inngest`, and anything that can name an event — a route, a server action, or a one-off script — can queue work. That is what lets a backfill run from a separate container without the app being restarted or aware of it.

### The receipt pipeline, end to end

1. **Compress.** The browser downscales the chosen photo to a 2000px longest edge and re-encodes it as JPEG (`lib/images/compress-receipt-image.ts`). EXIF orientation is baked in, so phone photos do not land sideways.
2. **Request an upload slot.** `POST /api/upload` validates the declared content type and size, inserts a receipt row with `status = 'uploading'` and an object key namespaced `users/<userId>/<uuid>.<ext>`, and returns a presigned PUT URL.
3. **Upload.** The browser PUTs the bytes straight to RustFS. Storage credentials never leave the server.
4. **Notification.** RustFS POSTs a bucket event to `/api/storage-events`, authenticated by the shared secret. The handler promotes the row `uploading → pending` and sends `receipt/uploaded` with a deterministic event id, so redelivery is deduped by Inngest rather than starting a second run. A non-2xx makes RustFS retry, and the retry re-enqueues instead of losing the extraction.
5. **Extract.** `transcribe-receipt` claims the row (`pending → processing`), downloads the image, and OCRs it with the vision model. The transcript is written as soon as it exists — if parsing then fails, it is the only evidence of what the image said. Next the transcript is parsed into the fixed extraction contract (`lib/db/contract.ts`) and validated against it, and in a final step the flat receipt fields, the line items, and the integrity warning are written and the row marked `done`. The warning is raised when the line items do not reconcile against the stated total.
6. **Categorize.** Extraction emits `receipt/extracted`; `categorize-receipt` loads the line items and the seeded leaf taxonomy, asks the model for one category per item, writes the assignments, and stamps `categorized_at`. It skips items whose category source is `user` — a category the owner chose is a decision, so a re-run must not overrule it.
7. **Notify the UI.** Throughout, the function publishes `extracting` / `parsing` / `storing` / `done` / `failed` on the receipt's realtime channel.

Each step is memoized by Inngest, so a crash or retry resumes rather than restarts.

### Processing status lifecycle

```
uploading ──▶ pending ──▶ processing ──▶ done
                                 │
                                 └──▶ error
```

`uploading` means the row exists and a presigned URL was issued; the browser may not have uploaded yet. `pending` means object storage confirmed the write. `processing` is the claim that a run owns the row — the guard against two concurrent runs. `done` and `error` are terminal.

A failed upload is not the same as a failed extraction: a receipt can be re-signed (`POST /api/upload/[receiptId]/retry`) for as long as it sits in `uploading`.

### Realtime

Each receipt has a channel `receipt:<id>`. Workers publish on it via `step.realtime.publish`; the browser subscribes with `useRealtime` (`hooks/use-receipt-realtime.ts`) using a token minted by `fetchReceiptSubscriptionToken`, which verifies the session and ownership first. The upload card uses it to follow a run in flight without polling.

### Chat

`/` is the front door and streams from `POST /api/chat`. The route authenticates, validates the client-supplied messages with `validateUIMessages`, strips every tool result except `ask_user` (a crafted request must not be able to talk the model into reporting figures no tool produced), builds a per-request `ToolLoopAgent`, and streams back.

The agent has six tools: five owner-scoped read-only queries over the database (`list_receipts`, `receipt_detail`, `search_line_items`, `spend_by_category`, `spend_by_merchant`) plus `ask_user`, a clarifying question the UI answers. `buildChatTools(ownerId)` closes the owner over server-side, so no tool takes an owner argument and the model can never supply one. Chat history is client-side only; a reload loses the thread.

## Running it locally

Prerequisites: Docker, Node 26, `pnpm`, and LM Studio with a model loaded.

1. Start LM Studio and load an OpenAI-compatible model at `http://localhost:1234/v1`.
   ```bash
   lms daemon up
   lms load glm-ocr
   lms load google/gemma-4-e4b --context-length 8192
   lms server start --port 1234
   ```
   Use the exact ids from `GET /v1/models` — quant suffixes are stripped (`glm-ocr`, not `glm-ocr@q8_0`).

2. Start the backing services.
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
   That brings up Postgres (`localhost:5432`), RustFS (API `localhost:9000`, console `localhost:9001`), `rustfs-init`, and the Inngest dev server (`localhost:8288`). It does **not** start the app.

3. Create `.env.local` (gitignored) — see [Configuration](#configuration).

4. Apply migrations and run the app.
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm db:migrate
   pnpm dev
   ```

The app is at `http://localhost:3000`, bound to `0.0.0.0` so the containers can reach it. RustFS's webhook and the Inngest dev server both point at `host.docker.internal:3000`, so the app must be up before an upload can complete.

Seeded demo data is available, but deliberately in a separate database:

```bash
docker exec receipt-app-postgres-1 createdb -U postgres receipts_seed
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/receipts_seed pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/receipts_seed pnpm dev
```

## Configuration

Everything has a working default; nothing is required to boot.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/receipts` | Postgres connection |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | — | Public app origin (required in production) |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | — | Auth signing secret (required in production) |
| `INVITE_CODE` | — | Shared code required to register. Unset means registration is closed |
| `STORAGE_ENDPOINT` | `localhost:9000` | RustFS, reached from the app |
| `STORAGE_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` | `STORAGE_ENDPOINT` | RustFS as the browser sees it (presigned URLs are signed against this host) |
| `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY` / `STORAGE_SECRET_KEY` | `rustfsadmin` | The app's IAM identity — least privilege, not root |
| `STORAGE_BUCKET` | `receipts` | Bucket holding receipt images |
| `STORAGE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | — | Bearer token RustFS sends on bucket notifications |
| `LM_STUDIO_URL` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | Local model server |
| `ORC_MODEL` | `glm-ocr` | Vision model for transcription |
| `PARSE_MODEL` | `google/gemma-4-e4b` | Model that turns a transcript into the contract |
| `CATEGORIZE_MODEL` | `PARSE_MODEL` | Model for categorization |
| `CHAT_MODEL` | `PARSE_MODEL` | Model for the chat agent |
| `INNGEST_DEV` / `INNGEST_BASE_URL` | `1` / `http://localhost:8288` | Point the app at the local Inngest dev server |
| `SEED_DATABASE_URL` | `…/receipts_seed` | Target for `pnpm db:seed` |

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # dev server on 0.0.0.0:3000
pnpm build        # production build
pnpm test         # Vitest
pnpm typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint         # ultracite check
pnpm fix          # ultracite fix — auto-fixes most issues

pnpm db:generate  # generate a migration from the Drizzle schema
pnpm db:migrate   # apply migrations
pnpm db:push      # push the schema without a migration
pnpm db:studio    # Drizzle Studio
pnpm db:seed      # reset + seed the dedicated seed database

pnpm categorize:backfill   # queue categorization for receipts with no stamp
```

Before committing: `pnpm fix` → `pnpm typecheck` → `pnpm test`. The pre-commit hook runs the tests and re-stages anything the formatter changed.

`lib/db/schema/` is the source of truth for domain types; derive new ones with Drizzle's Zod helpers rather than re-declaring fields.

## Deployment

Production is a single Coolify **Compose** resource defined in `docker-compose.coolify.yml`, running on a Mac mini behind a Cloudflare tunnel.

- **Images** build from the repo `Dockerfile` with three targets: `runner` (the app), `migrator` (one-shot `pnpm db:migrate` at deploy), and `toolbox` (a long-lived idle container that exists only to be exec'd into for on-demand jobs).
- **Migrations never run at app startup.** The `migrate` service completes successfully before the app starts, so the server never runs ahead of the schema.
- **Secrets are Coolify magic variables**, generated per environment. The repo holds no credentials. The app authenticates to storage as a least-privilege IAM user created by `rustfs-init`; root credentials are used only by init and the console.
- **The Cloudflare tunnel is the only public ingress.** Postgres and RustFS publish host ports for LAN/tailnet admin access only.
- **Deploys** are a PR → merge to `main` → the Coolify GitHub App auto-deploys. Rollback is one click in Coolify.

Backups are configured per environment in the Coolify UI: a volume backup of `postgres-data` plus a `pg_dump` scheduled task whose command ends in `pg_restore -l`, so the task's exit status is a real validation. Both are same-host — they protect against a bad deploy, not against losing the machine. Off-box storage is the planned destination and is not yet configured. `rustfs-data` is not backed up.

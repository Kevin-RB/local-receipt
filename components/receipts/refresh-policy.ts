/**
 * Whether a receipt's transition owes the page a server refresh.
 *
 * The live stage is rendered client-side from the message, so nothing needs a
 * refresh while a run is `extracting`/`parsing`/`storing`. Two transitions do:
 *
 * - **Terminal.** `done` means the run committed the stored row — status,
 *   totals, merchant, integrity — and the message carries the stage, not that
 *   data, so it has to be fetched. `failed` may have restored a previous
 *   status, so the stored badge can differ from what "error" implies.
 * - **A receipt not on the page starts.** Its row did not exist when the page
 *   rendered, so it takes one refresh to appear at all. Rows already rendered
 *   never need this — their badge overlays the live stage.
 *
 * Returning `none` for a repeated terminal means a receipt refreshes once per
 * completion, not once per message, and again only if it is re-processed.

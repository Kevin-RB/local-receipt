 *   the sender may not own it, so a failed run has nothing to report about it.
 *   Writing anyway would let a forged event flip the status of any receipt by
 *   id — hiding it from the editor and from every spend query.
 * - The receipt is already `done`, because `storing` writes `done` as its last
 *   act. Restoring the pre-run status over it would report a failure against
 *   data that is there and correct.
 *
 * Otherwise a re-process restores the status it started from: the stored
 * extraction is only replaced in the final `storing` step, so an earlier
 * failure leaves it fully intact and the receipt should keep saying so. A first
 * extraction has nothing to fall back to and is `error`.
